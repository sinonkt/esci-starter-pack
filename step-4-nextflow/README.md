see also [Official Nextflow Doc](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/)

Install Nextflow

```
wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```
After this command we will get nextflow binary file. for convenient we will move nextflow to `~/bin/nextflow` so that we can use `nextflow` globally
```
mkdir -p ~/bin
mv nextflow ~/bin
chmod u+x ~/bin/nextflow
```
